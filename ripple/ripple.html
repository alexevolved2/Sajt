                <p class="text-blue">What if, what you really need is feedback , help, ideas. Even some inspiration?
                    Not tutoring, or actual lessons.
                    Maybe you just have one tiny problem.
                    Like starting 60 tracks in the past few months, getting all of them to 80% completion.
                    But you can’t seem to complete a single one.
                    Something’s missing, but you don’t know what.
                    It’d be a shame to let all those tracks gather dust on the harddrive.
                    So find a mentor, or someone to collab with.
                    Who knows, that someone could be both!
                    Or you’re the type that receives feedback best when it’s structured, instead of unstructured.
                    Find a like-minded mentor who matches your style!
                    Or things have been tough for a while, and you’re thinking of quitting music.
                   </p>
                <p class="text-blue"> Could be, all you need is a gentle hand on your back, urging you on.
                    A gentle hand from someone, letting you know you’re not alone.
                    From someone who understands what it’s like.
                    Who can help get you back to that place of determination, hard work, and sheer refusal to
                    give up.</p>
                <p class="text-blue">
                    Whichever your need, wouldn’t it be great to have some honest,
                    direct-yet-gentle feedback or encouragement?
                    Or ideas. Or suggestions. Or advice.
                    So you can improve.
                    So you can get those 60 tracks up to 100% completion, upload them, and start getting offers
                    for them.

                Some are students, with a gift for teaching music.
